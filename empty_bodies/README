Module  : Empty Bodies
Version : 1.0.3
Author  : Maurice Makaay (based on a first implementation by Thomas Seifert)

Allow empty bodies in messages, so forum users can commit quick comments by
only using the subject line. The module will also add a string to the
subject and body to identify empty messages. These strings can be customized
through the language files.

Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "empty_bodies" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Empty Bodies".
