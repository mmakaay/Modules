Changelog:
----------

2006-08-20 v1.0.3

    - Changed the common hook a bit to detect an empty body correctly
      in case $_POST data is sent unchanged to the server. In this case
      empty_body=1 and body=n/t is sent. Before the change, the "n/t" in the
      body would cause the script to set empty_body to 0 and use "n/t" as
      the new body.

2007-01-21 v1.0.2

    - The editmessage (Edit [x] times. Last edit at [y] by [z]) and
      possible additions to the body (e.g. by other modules) are now
      kept intact.

    - The BBcode module adds a space to the start of the body, which
      confused the Empty Bodies module a bit. The module is now
      compatible with this.

2006-01-17 v1.0.1

    - The module now makes use of Phorum 5.1 hooks for good integration
      with the posting editor..

    - Added feature to print subject suffix (n/t) and body string 
      for empty messages. The strings to use are configured using
      the localization files.

    - If a user enters "n/t" in the body himself, the message now counts
      as not being empty.

2006-01-11 v1.0.0

    - Initial release.
