!! Not all modules from this directory have been tested with Phorum 5.1 !!

They might work, but they might as well not. When we migrated to GitHub,
we did our best to update the module repository to provide the correct
modules for the various branches (master, phorum_5_1, phorum_5_2), but
since require_version was not supported way back, we have no tracking
of Phorum version compatibility for older modules.

If you find a module that is not compatible, please let us know, so we
can update this historic repository.
