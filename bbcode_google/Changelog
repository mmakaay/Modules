   - Google icon updated, see:
     http://googleblog.blogspot.de/2015/09/google-update.html

   - URL in info.txt added.

   - Performance improvements.

2007-11-02 v1.1.0

   - Branched off the 5.1.x version of the module. From now on, 1.1.0 and
     higher will be Phorum 5.2 based.

   - Make use of the new css_register and javascript_register hooks.
     This requires Phorum 5.2.2 or newer.

   - Put the description for the editor tool button in a language file,
     as requested by Tomasz Regdos.

2007-11-01 v1.0.7

   - Renamed the module from "Google links" to "BBcode Google", to match
     the other BBcode extension modules.

   - Honor the "disable bbcode for this post" flag (a feature of the
     BBcode module).

2007-07-07 v1.0.6

    - Added an option to be able to switch the Editor Tools button
      on and off.

2006-07-12 v1.0.5

    - Fixed the tool button to work correctly within a
      portable / embedded environment.

2006-07-12 v1.0.4

    - Added a tool button for the Editor Tools module.

2006-02-20 v1.0.3

    - Updated the used google logo to a cleaner one.

2006-02-20 v1.0.2

    - Moved the CSS from right after printing the header to
      $PHORUM["DATA"]["HEAD_TAGS"], so the style definition will be
      inside the <head>. That will make the HTML generated by this
      mod validate.

      IMPORTANT: To make this work, you will have to disable and
      re-enable the module after unpacking the files, because the
      hook functions in info.txt were changed.

2006-01-23 v1.0.1

    - The links can now be fully styled by creating a CSS class
      named "phorum_mod_google_links". Settings have been added
      to influence and fully disable the built-in stylesheet
      for the module.

2006-01-23 v1.0.0

    - Initial release
