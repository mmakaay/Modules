Upgrading FancyBox:
-------------------

Upgrading the FancyBox code is pretty simple:

- Download FancyBox from http://fancybox.net/
- Unpack the downloaded zip file.
- Move the files that are inside the directory "fancybox" of the unpacked
  zip file into the code subdirectory.
- Update function.php and update the FANCYBOX_VERSION to match the version
  number for the new code.
