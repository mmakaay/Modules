One thing that had to be done to make it possible to easily override
the settings, was commenting out the following line of code in the
stock javascript code:

    // thumbnailviewer.createthumbBox();

Also, fixed viewing of large images. When centering, those went outside
the left side of the screen, making them unreachable.

    function centerDiv:

    //Center div element horizontally
    if (objwidth > docwidth) {
        divobj.style.left=0;
    } else {
        divobj.style.left=docwidth/2-objwidth/2+"px";
    }
