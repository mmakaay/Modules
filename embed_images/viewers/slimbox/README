When upgrading the slimbox code, change "domready" to "load" to prevent
some MSIE problems. Since we already setup the events right after loading
an image, we actually would not need this line for all images that we
add from the embed_image module. It's only here for catching some extra
slimbox thumbnails that possibly are put in the page in another way.

The line should read:

window.addEvent('load', Lightbox.init.bind(Lightbox));
