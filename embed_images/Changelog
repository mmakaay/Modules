Changelog:
----------

2011-03-29 v1.1.4

    - Implemented a new hashing scheme for the cache directory (in case
      a custom cache directory is in use). This results in more files
      per hashed cache directory, but this should be fine on OS'es
      nowadays. Hosting providers seem to have more problems with deep
      directory structures than with large directories.

    - Prevented one level of created directories that was not needed.
      (for /.../someimage.jpg, a directory /.../someimage was create too)

2011-01-12 v1.1.3

    - Upgraded the FancyBox code to version 1.3.4.
      Thanks to phorum.org user "noe" for doing some prework on a issue
      that occurred with FancyBox in combination with a new version of
      jQuery (1.4.4). The fix for that is included in this release.

2010-10-22 v1.1.2

    - Fixed formatting of embedded images in signatures on the
      user's control center start page.

    - Fixed the CSS code for Fancybox to correctly show the shadows
      for the lightbox.

    - Implemented debugging features to help people track issues
      with this module. In the module settings page, checks are done to
      see if HTTP GET and image scaling support is available on the hosting
      platform. Furthermore, a debugging switch can be enabled, which
      makes the embedded images in the front end return a detailed debug
      log of the image loading and scaling process.

    - Added new German language files. Thanks to Oliver Riesen!

2010-10-18 v1.1.1

    - Fixed an image displaying issue for FancyBox in MSIE. This was a well
      known issue with the FancyBox CSS code and the relative image paths that
      are used in there. It was fixed by loading and filtering the CSS code,
      to replace all image URLs with absolute URLs for those images.

    - Switched to using the parsing facilities as offered by the BBcode
      module to take care of processing [img] (and possibly surrounding
      [url]) tags. This prevents formatting issues for cases where
      the user did not correctly format the tags.
      A change in the BBcode module was required for this release.
      For this reason, the required Phorum version is 5.2.16.

2010-10-16 v1.1.0

    - Implemented two new viewers for the Embed Images module:
      * jQuery Lightbox (http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/)
      * FancyBox (http://fancybox.net)

    - The two new viewers make use of the jQuery library that is bundled with
      Phorum 5.2.16 and higher. For this reason, the required Phorum
      version for this module has been set to 5.2.16.

    - Added French translation. Thanks to Phorum user cactux.
      In relation with the French translation, a bug was fixed that prevented
      the use of a ' character in the loading message.

    - Fixed rendering of automatically embedded attachments when doing a
      preview during a message edit operation. Before, the image would
      show up as [embed_image XXXXXXXXXX].

2009-06-01 v1.0.9

    - Made the module compatible with changes in the 5.3 development tree.

2008-07-31 v1.0.8

    - Implemented slimbox 1.64 + mootools 1.2 as a new image viewer.

2008-06-23 v1.0.7

    - Added some more HTML validation fixes as provided by Oliver Riesen.

2008-05-15 v1.0.6

    - Made BBcode [url] recognition case insensitive to match
      the BBcode module behavior.

    - Updated the German language files with new language files
      provided by Oliver Riesen.

    - Added some HTML validation fixes to the Dynamic Drive image viewer,
      as provided by Oliver Riesen.

2008-03-03 v1.0.5

    - A small (backward compatible) change to make the Embed Images module
      compatible with the Image API for Phorum 5.2.7 or higher. The updated
      Image API scales down images as JPG instead of PNG. This module did not
      handle the MIME type "image/jpeg" for caching the data yet.

    - Added Russian translation. Thanks to Phorum user EugenR.

2008-01-18 v1.0.4

    - Use "@ini_set" instead of "ini_set", to let the module ignore
      problems on systems where the ini_set() function was disabled
      by the administrator.

    - Changed the slimbox "domready" event to "load" to prevent conflicts
      in MSIE. We can safely do this without causing images to be clickable
      only after the full page loaded, because we have some custom code
      in the module that will setup a viewer for the images right after
      putting them in the page.

2007-12-12 v1.0.3

    - Added German translation. Thanks Hiiri!

    - Added clear:both style for <br/> tags in the message body to make
      floating divs behave better. This is also in the main template,
      but since people might not copy that code, I added the styling
      in the template for this module as well.

2007-12-11 v1.0.2

    - Added ".jpeg" as a recognized extension for images.

    - Removed some htmlspecialchar() calls around phorum_get_url(), which
      could lead to non-working URLs in some environments.

2007-11-26 v1.0.1

    - Implemented different behavior for images that do not have to be
      scaled down. Before, they would not be clickable to open them in a
      viewer. Now they are clickable, but they will not be shown using
      the magnifier icon. The main reason for this is to make the image
      part of a slideshow if a slideshow based viewer like Lightbox or
      Slimbox is used.

2007-11-25 v1.0.0

    - Initial release.
