Module  : Embed Images
Version : 1.1.4
Author  : Maurice Makaay <maurice@phorum.org>

This module implements several image viewers that can be used for viewing
images inside forum messages. The images are shown as scaled down thumbnails
in the message, so large images won't break the page layout. By clicking the
image, the users can view the full size image in the configured viewer.

The module will recognize:

* [img]...[/img] BBcode style images
* <img ...> HTML style images (if the HTML module is enabled)
* Image attachments that are added to the body by the Embed Attachment module
* Bare image URLs that point to .jpg, .png or .gif files

Features:

* A maximum width and/or height for images can be configured. If an image
  exceeds the allowed size, a thumbnail image will be generated.
* Phorum 5.2's image API code is used for consistent image scaling.
* Images for which a thumbnail is generated will be shown in a frame
  containing a looking glass icon to inform the user that a larger view
  is available.
* For viewing the image in full size, multiple viewers are available,
  ranging from simply using the webrowser as the viewer up to highly
  dynamic javascript-driven viewers.
* Images that are inside a link (using BBcode [url=...]...[/url] or
  <a href="...">...</a> if the HTML module is enabled) will be shown
  in a frame containing a link icon to inform the user that by clicking the
  image, a different URL will be loaded.
* Two thumbnail caching methods are available. By default the Phorum cache
  layer is used. However, this is a non-permanent cache, since it does have
  a TTL (time to live) for the cached items. In the module settings, you can
  configure a filesystem path for storing the thumbnail cache. This cache is
  permanent.
* When using the built-in filesystem cache system, it is possible to specify
  the http URL at which this cache directory is accessible through the web.
  By doing so, the module will use links that point directly to the thumbnail
  images. This is the fastest caching option available, since the images don't
  have to be served through the script. Please read the security notice in the
  module settings if you want to use this feature.
* For clients that support Ajax, the module implements staged loading of
  the embedded images if they are not available in the cache yet.
  This makes it possible to show a "Loading ..." notification and to
  present real errors in case the server cannot serve an image for some
  reason. This mainly was done to have clear visual feedback when previewing
  a new message. This prevents user reports about not working message
  previews in case the image scaling is slow for some reason (big image,
  slow remote server, busy system, etc.).
* JavaScript is not neccessary for the client. Without JavaScript, the
  module will gracefully fall back to a basic non-JavaScript solution.
