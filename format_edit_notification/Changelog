Changelog:
----------

2008-12-07 1.0.2

    - Added support for the Readable Dates module. That module uses a custom
      edit message for replacing the original one. Replacing the edit
      message with the edit message from the Readable Dates module
      stripped our special markers, causing this module to not recognize
      the edit message anymore.

2007-12-08 1.0.1

    - Default settings were not seen, because they were not set in
      the global $PHORUM variable.

2007-09-27 1.0.0

    - Initial release
