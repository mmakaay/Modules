Module  : Embed Attachments
Version : 1.0.1
Author  : Maurice Makaay

This module requires Phorum 5.2.2 or later.

This module makes it possible to put links that point to the attachments
for a message inline at any position in the message body. Other modules
(like "Embed Images" and "Embed MP3") can be installed to replace these
links by embedded attachment viewers.


Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "embed_attachments" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Embed Attachments".
