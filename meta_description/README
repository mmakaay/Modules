Module  : Meta Description
Version : 1.1.3
Author  : Maurice Makaay

This module will set the {DESCRIPTION} template variable to an appropriate
value for using it in a meta description HTML tag. The 5.2 code +
standard emerald template already do set a meta description header
in the header.tpl, but this module allows for somewhat more fine grained
control over the amount of data that is put in the meta description tag.

By default, the text from the "Phorum Description" setting (admin interface,
"General Settings") will be used. Except on the list and read pages.

On the list page (the thread overview), the description for the forum
will be used as the meta description. The description can be changed by
editing the description for the forum (from the forum's settings in the
admin interface).

On the message read page, an excerpt from the thread-starting message
will be used as the meta description. How much of the message is used
in the excerpt can be configured from the settings for this module.

Note:
Make sure that you do not have a meta description tag configured in the
"Phorum Head Tags" option in the admin interface. If you do so, your
page will end up with two meta tags, which might confuse search engines.

Thanks to Brian Moon for inspiring me for writing this module by
publishing his template hack.
