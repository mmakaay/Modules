Module  : Limit threaded views
Version : 1.0.1
Author  : Maurice Makaay <maurice@phorum.org>

This module requires Phorum 5.2 or newer.

This module allows admins to setup limits for threaded list and read views.
If a limit is reached, then the module will switch the view mode back to
flat view. This can be useful in case there are threads in a forum that
are too large for the system to process quickly.

If you have large threads on your forum (hundreds or thousands of messages)
and are experiencing timeouts / extraneous CPU usage on viewing those in
threaded views (threaded list, threaded or hybrid read), then this module
will help you save your system resources.


Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "limit_threaded_views" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Limit threaded views".

- Configure what limits you want to use and whether you want to show a
  notification to the user when switching to flat view by editing the
  module's settings. It is also okay to use the defaults of course.


Template customization:
-----------------------

A module template is used for displaying the notification to the user.
You can create a separate notification template for each Phorum template
that you are using.

First, create a directory within the module's templates directory named
mods/limit_threaded_views/templates/<template> (where <template> is the
name of the Phorum template for which you want to write a customized
module template).

Then copy the notification.tpl files from the default template directory
to your new directory and start editing this file.


Language customization:
-----------------------

This module does support multiple languages. You can add a language by
creating a language file in mods/limit_threaded_views/lang/<language>.php,
where the filename should be the same as the language filename that you are
using for Phorum itself (i.e. include/lang/<language>.php). The easiest
way is to copy the english.php to the new filename and start editing that
file. If you create a new language file, then please post it to the
module's discussion thread in the Phorum.org forums.
