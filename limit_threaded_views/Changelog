Changelog:
----------

2011-04-04 v1.0.1

    - Fixed an undefined index warning about "list_threaded", which turned
      out to be a tell sign for a bug that caused the limiting to fail on a
      threaded list page.

    - Modified the module to make use of newer hooks in Phorum, which makes
	    the module slightly more efficient. This also allows me to prevent
      a conflict with a future module that I am working on currently
      (Quick Settings).

2007-11-12 v1.0.0

    - Initial release
