Module  : Development: Timing
Version : 1.0.0
Author  : Maurice Makaay <maurice@phorum.org>

This module adds timing information to the page output. This module is
mainly useful for Phorum developers that need timing information for
spotting and fixing performance issues.

Note: this module will display timing information to every user. Therefore,
it's best to not enable this module on a live system.


Installation:
-------------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "devel_timing" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Development: Timing".
