Changelog:
----------

2008-07-23 v1.0.4

   - Fixed a bug in the error output that is written to the start of
     the javascript.php in case the yuicompressor call fails.
     The error output was not correctly formatted as a javascript comment,
     causing a syntax error in the javascript.

2008-07-23 v1.0.3

   - Upgraded YUI compressor to version 2.4.2.

2008-06-08 v1.0.2

   - Added code to let Phorum rebuild the javascript cache if this module
     is enabled or if the module code changes.

   - The settings screen now attempts to find the java program in the
     system's search path. The provided information on the settings
     screen will change, based on the outcome.

2008-06-02 v1.0.1

   - Use full path to the compressor jar file. On some installs, the
     shell will be started in / instead of the Phorum directory.

2008-05-25 v1.0.0

   - Initial release.
