Module  : Compress Javascript using YUI Compressor
Version : 1.0.4
Author  : Maurice Makaay

This module compresses the Phorum Javascript code using Yahoo's excellent
YUI Compressor. The JavaScript code can be compressed to less than 50%
of its original size. This reduces bandwidth usage and speeds up the
JavaScript code. This module needs java >= 1.4 on the server to function.

For the YUI Compressor license, see yuicompressor.license.txt or go to
http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html


Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "compress_yui" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Compress Javascript using YUI Compressor".

- Edit the settings for the module to specify the path to your java
  virtual machine, when it is not in a standard location on the system.


Troubleshooting:
----------------

If anything goes wrong in the compression, the module will write out the
error(s) at the start of the JavaScript output. To see them, open
