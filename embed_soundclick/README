Module  : Embed Soundclick
Version : 1.0.2
Author  : Maurice Makaay <maurice@phorum.org>

Soundclick is a web site (http://www.soundclick.com) where musicians can
post their audio and video files. This module recognizes soundclick URLs
in messages and replaces them with embedded players, so the files can be
played directly from the message.


Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "embed_soundclick" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Embed Soundclick".
