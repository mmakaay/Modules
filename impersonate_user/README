Module  : Impersonate User
Version : 1.0.6
Author  : Maurice Makaay

Allows administrators to (temporarily) impersonate a different user,
which can be useful when investigating user specific problems.

Impersonating can be done by clicking on a link in the target user's profile
screen. It is also possible to search for a user in the user control center
(new menu item: Impersonate user) and work directly from there.

For running this mod, you need Phorum 5.2.1-alpha or later. It will not
work for earlier versions of Phorum.


Installation:
-------------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "impersonate_user" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Impersonate User".
