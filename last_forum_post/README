Module  : Last Forum Post
Version : 1.1.1
Author  : Maurice Makaay
Patches : James Revillini

This module keeps track of the last post that has been done in each forum
(similar to the last post functionality that is already available for
each thread).

The name of the last author and message subject will be made available
through the template variables for the forums on the index page. These
can be shown on the forum index page by modifying the template. See the
installation instructions below for more info.


Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "last_forum_post" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Last Forum Post".

- Go to the settings page for the module and click "Rebuild last post info
  for all forums". After installing, the last post info will only become
  available for each forum after a new message has been posted in the forum.
  So you won't see the info appear immediately. By using this rebuild page,
  you can manually bring your forums up to speed.

- Edit the index*.tpl templates to include the recent author info.
  The available template variables inside the {LOOP FORUMS} are:

    {FORUMS->last_post}       The date and time of the last post.
                              (this one is available without this module too)

    {FORUMS->last_subject}    The subject of the last post.

    {FORUMS->URL->MESSAGE}    The URL that points directly to the last post.

    {FORUMS->last_author}     The name of the author of the last post.

    {FORUMS->URL->PROFILE}    The URL that point to the last author's profile.


  Here's a suggestion for modifying the templates (index*.tpl).
  The "{FORUMS->last_post}" is already available in the template,
  so it's easiest to search for "last_post" in your template and
  go from there:

   {FORUMS->last_post}
   {IF FORUMS->last_subject}
     <br/>
     <a href="{FORUMS->URL->MESSAGE}">{FORUMS->last_subject}</a>
     <br/>
     {LANG->by}
     {IF FORUMS->URL->PROFILE}<a href="{FORUMS->URL->PROFILE}">{/IF}
       {FORUMS->last_author}
     {IF FORUMS->URL->PROFILE}</a>{/IF}
   {/IF}

  The {IF FORUMS->last_subject} construction is used to prevent PHP from
  throwing errors when no last post info is available for a forum yet.
