2007-12-28 v2.4.0 - Maurice Makaay

    - Full rewrite release to make full use of new Phorum features.

    - Added module template support to pull the markup code from
      the module code.

    - Records are only shown when available, so the module won't show
      "<empty> on Januari 1, 1970" after installation anymore.

    - Admin users are now indicated by (admin) after their name.
      The "Online Users (Administrator)" header was to unclear to users.

    - Added support for styling through CSS.

    - For guests counts, Google, Yahoo and unknown clients are not counted
      anymore. In the future, we might add extra clients, but these are the
      most apparent ones to push up the guest count.

    - The idle time for a user is now shown in "m:ss" format.

    - The settings page is compressed by putting option help in help
      balloons.

    - If the Phorum user tracking is disabled or higher than the configured
      idle time for this module, the settings screen will show a clear
      error message and a description of what to do about the problem.

    - Cleaned up some code that could be replaced with new 5.2 API code.

    - Added support for 5.2 display names (where the admin can choose whether
      the username or the real_name for the user has to be used as the
      display name).

    - Added support for also keeping track of the number of guest readers
      in a forum.

    - Improved the code for counting forum readers by not setting the
      count for each forum to zero before counting the readers. We can
      simply asume zero readers if the forum_id is not available in the
      reader list. This will also prevent possible undefined index
      errors in case new forums are added.

    - Users for which "hide_activity" is configured are added to the
      guest count. They will still count as a user for determining the
      record number of users.

    - Added some default settings for the module.

2007-12-14 v2.3.1 - Sunbringer

    - Modified version to work with 5.2.
