title: Post Count Tagging
desc: This module allows you to setup rules for creating custom template variables, which depend on a user's post count. This can for example be used to add some custom user status (e.g. "rookie", "regular", "veteran") to the users.  Assignment can be done to authors in the read pages, to the user in the profile pages and to the logged in Phorum user on every page.
