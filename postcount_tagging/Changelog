----------

2007-10-24 v1.0.1

    - Bugfix: added missing return statement in the after_post hook.
      A visual effect of the missing return statement was that the
      feature to jump to the message read page after posting a message
      did not work anymore. You would always end up at the list page,
      regardless the admin configuration.

2007-10-21 v1.0.0

    - Initial release
