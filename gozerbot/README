Module  : Gozerbot
Version : 1.0.1
Author  : Maurice Makaay

"Gozerbot" (http://www.gozerbot.org) is an IRC bot, written in python.
This module makes it possible to use Gozerbot for doing various
notifications to a #channel or nickname on IRC.

Implemented notifications are:

* new threads that are posted
* new reply messages that are posted

Here's a very cool ASCII art of the route that a notifcation message takes:

+--------+          +----------+         +----------------------+
| Phorum |---UDP--->| Gozerbot |---IRC-->| #channel or nickname |
+--------+          +----------+         | on the IRC server    |
                                         +----------------------+

Phorum and Gozerbot do not have to run on the same system to make this
setup work. You can use a gozerbot running on any system, as long as
you configure the Gozerbot to accept UDP traffic from the host that
is running Phorum.


Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "gozerbot" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Gozerbot";

- Edit the settings for the module to setup the connection to the
  Gozerbot UDP server.

- The notifications are sent to the Gozerbot UDP server. This UDP server
  is not enabled by default. If you are running Gozerbot without UDP support,
  then edit the udp* config parameters to enable UDP and reboot Gozerbot.
  Below, you see the part of the configuration that applies to the UDP
  support. For details on setting up Gozerbot and these configuration
  parameters, please refer to the Gozerbot documentation.

    udp = 1
    partyudp = 0
    udpipv6 = 0
    udphost = 'localhost'
    udpport = 5500
    udpmasks = ['192.168*', ]   # access from a masked range of IP addresses
    udpallow = ['127.0.0.1', ]  # access from a specific IP address
    udpallowednicks = ['#channel', '#otherchannel', 'nickname']
    udppassword = 'mypass'
    udpseed = "supersecretkey!!"
    udpstrip = 1


Troubleshooting:
----------------

I you cannot get messages to transmit to a remotely hosted Gozerbot,
then check the following issues:

- whether the Gozerbot port is not being blocked by a firewall
  (check both the outgoing firewall on the host that is running Phorum and
  the incoming firewall on the host that is running Gozerbot);

- whether Gozerbot uses udpmasks/udpallow to grant access to the
  IP address of the host on which Phorum is hosted;

- whether Gozerbot listens on the public interface IP address
  and not on localhost (udphost = 'localhost' is wrong here, try
  replacing it with udphost = '0.0.0.0' to make Gozerbot listen
  on all network interfaces);

- whether the configured password and crypt key match exactly with
  respectively the udppassword and udpseed options from the Gozerbot
  config file.


Customization:
--------------

You can translate the notification messages that this module
sends to Gozerbot by creating a language file in
"mods/gozerbot/lang/<yourlang>.php". In this filename <yourlang> has to
be the same name as the main language file that you use
(i.e. "include/lang/<yourlang>.php"). If you write a translation for this
module, then please post it in the module's thread at phorum.org, so I
can include it in the distribution.
