Changelog:
----------

2008-03-05 v1.0.1

   - Made the language file more flexable for customization.

   - Added some bold formatting to the notification message for better
     readability.

   - Added an option to exclude the forum paths from the notification
     messages, so you can show "My Forum" instead of
     "My Folder / My Subfolder / My Forum". This can be useful if you
     are not using folders extensively or if the forum names are descriptive
     enough on their own.

   - Added support for tinyurl.com to generate small URLs that are easier
     to handle in the IRC channel. To use this feature, PHP must have the
     curl extension enabled.

2008-03-05 v1.0.0

   - Initial release.
