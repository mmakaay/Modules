title: Fix Proxy IP
desc: This module can be used when your server is running behind a proxy server. In such case, Phorum will not see the IP-address of the client, but the one of the proxy. If the proxy is proper, it will send along a X-Forwarded-For header, telling the original IP-address. This module will let Phorum use the IP-address from that header if it is available in the request.
