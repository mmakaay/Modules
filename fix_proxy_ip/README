Module  : Fix Proxy IP
Version : 1.0.1
Author  : Maurice Makaay

This module can be used when your server is running behind a proxy server.
In such case, Phorum will not see the IP-address of the client, but the one
of the proxy. If the proxy is proper, it will send along a X-Forwarded-For
header, telling the original IP-address. This module will let Phorum use the
IP-address from that header if it is available in the request.


Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "fix_proxy_ip" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Fix Proxy IP".
