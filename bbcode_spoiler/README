Module  : BBcode Spoiler
Version : 1.0.9
Author  : Maurice Makaay <maurice@phorum.org>

This module adds the bbcode [spoiler]...[/spoiler], which can be used for
adding a spoiler to a message (a spoiler is information that you do not
want to show right away to the reader of the message, e.g. a movie plot
or a solution to a puzzle, because that could spoil some fun for the reader).
The reader can then decide on his own whether he wants to read the spoiler
or not.

The spoiler is implemented in such way that the spoiler data is not loaded
at all. This way, it is guaranteed that the spoiler data is invisible, even
if the user is using a text browser like "lynx" or if the user is viewing
the page source. When the reader clicks the link to open the spoiler, then
the spoiler content is loaded using a JavaScript Ajax request. For browsers
that do not support this technology, a fallback URL is provided, which will
reload the page with the requested spoiler data visible. For these reasons,
the accessibility of this spoiler module is very good.

Examples:

  [spoiler=The ending of movie FooBar]
  In the end, they wake up and it all appears to be just a bad dream.
  Mister Baz brushes his teeth, grabs some bread and takes off to work.
  His wife remains silent ever after.
  [/spoiler]

  How much is 10 times 5?
  [spoiler]50, but you could have computed that yourself![/spoiler]
