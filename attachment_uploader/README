Module  : Attachment Uploader
Version : 1.0.2
Authors : Maurice Makaay

This module improves the attachment uploading process. It implements
attaching and detaching files for a message, without having to refresh
the page. For buzzword compliancy, you could think of it as an
"Ajax Uploader", although Ajax technology cannot be used for uploading
files.

Features:

- Attach files to messages without page reloading;
- Detach files from messages without page reloading;
- Show an error if the user hits "Attach" without selecting a file;
- If errors occur during uploading, a popup will show the error;
- Cross browser JavaScript (tested in MSIE6, FireFox, Opera and Konqueror).


Installation:
-------------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "attachment_uploader" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Edit your template (see instructions below);

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Attachment Uploader";


Template customization:
-----------------------

To make the attachment uploader module work, you will have to update
your template. Only a small change is needed if your template is based
on the Emerald template.

Open the template file "posting.tpl". Find the start of the attachments
code in that file (starting around line 166 with {IF ATTACHMENTS}). Add
the boxed text from below to this spot in the template

      ......
      ......
      _________________________________________________________
     |                                                         |
     | <div id="attachments-container">                        |
     |_________________________________________________________|

           {IF ATTACHMENTS}
      ......
      ......

Then go to line 213, where you have to add this boxed code:

      ......
      ......
          {/IF}
      _________________________________________________________
     |                                                         |
     | </div> <!-- end of attachments-container -->            |
     |_________________________________________________________|

       {HOOK "tpl_editor_before_textarea"}
      ......
      ......
