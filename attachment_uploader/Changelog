Changelog:
----------

2011-04-01 v1.0.2

   - Made the module work for cases where the attachment form is placed
     below the textarea in the editor.

2008-02-22 v1.0.1

   - Fixed some problems for the case where the maximum number of
     attachments was reached.

   - Added an activity indicator image when uploading a file.

   - Restricted copying back of form data to the main form to only copy
     the fields that are important for the attachments management. This
     allows for further editing of the message (e.g. subject and body)
     while the attachment upload is taking place.
