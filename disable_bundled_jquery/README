Module  : Disable Bundled jQuery
Version : 1.0.0
Author  : Maurice Makaay

This mod suppresses the loading of the bundled jQuery library, which can
be useful in case a jQuery library is already loaded in another way for
your site.

Note that there is no risk that the Phorum jQuery library will conflict
with your own jQuery version. Phorum does make use of the noConflict
feature of jQuery, to not let the library conflict with other libraries
that are loaded for the site. The main reason for disabling the bundled
library would therefore be to spare some resources. 

Install:
--------

  - Unpack the archive;

  - Move the directory "disable_bundled_jquery" to the directory "mods"
    within your Phorum installation;

  - Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
    go to the "Modules" section;

  - Enable the module "Disable Bundled jQuery".
