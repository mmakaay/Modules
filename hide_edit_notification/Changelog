Changelog:
----------

2008-06-05 v1.1.0

    - Rewrite for Phorum 5.2.

    - The edit message is now hidden dynamically, which means that the
      edit message is also hidden for already posted messages. This is
      different from the 5.1 version of the module, which changed the
      actual edit count for the message at post time.
			
      The big advantage of the new method is that the edit count value
      won't get lost. It will also keep the "View changes" functionality
      intact.

    - Renamed the module from "Drop Edit Message" to "Hide Edit Notification"
      to reflect the new functionality a bit better and to match the name
      of the "Format Edit Notification" module.
