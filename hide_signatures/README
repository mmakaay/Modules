Module  : Hide Signatures
Version : 1.1.1
Author  : Maurice Makaay

This mod adds a configuration option for users, which can be used
to disable viewing of user signatures. The option can be found in
the user's control center under the "Forum Settings" item.


Install:
--------

- Install this file in the directory "mods" within your
  Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Hide Signatures".

- At the first time that this module is run (by visiting the forums),
  the module will automatically create a custom profile field for
  storing the user setting for this module. You should be able to
  see the mod_hide_signatures field in the admin interface under
  "Custom Profile".


Customization:
--------------

This module makes use of a module template for showing the option for
disabling signature displaying in the users's control center. If you want
to modify the template to make it work better for your site's template,
then do not edit the template files that were in the module distribution.
Instead, copy the directory "mods/hide_signatures/templates/default" to
"mods/hide_signatures/templates/yourtemplatename" (asuming that your site's
template is stored as "templates/yourtemplatename") and edit the template
file in the new directory. Phorum will automatically recognize that you have
created a specific module template to use for your site.
