Module  : Hide Signatures
Version : 1.0.1
Author  : Maurice Makaay

This mod adds a configuration option for users that can be used
to disable viewing of user signatures. The option can be found in
the user's control center under the forum settings option.

For running this mod, you need Phorum 5.1.7-RC1 or later, because
of the features that are used. You could try to run the mod on an
earlier 5.1.x release, but then you will have to add the following
code to the cc_usersettings.tpl template manually, just before the
ending </table> of the settings table:

  {HOOK tpl_cc_usersettings PROFILE}


Install:
--------

- Install this file in the directory "mods" within your 
  Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Hide Signatures".

- At the first time that this module is run (by visiting the forums),
  the module will automatically create a custom profile field for 
  storing the user setting for this module. You should be able to
  see the mod_hide_signatures field in the admin interface under 
  "Custom Profile".
