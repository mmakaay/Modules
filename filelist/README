Module  : File List
Version : 1.0.5
Author  : Maurice Makaay

This module requires Phorum 5.1.x.
For 5.2.x you need a new version of this module.

This module adds a file list on the read page for a thread, which lists
all attachments that are available in the full thread. The administrator
can configure per forum if and how the file list should be displayed.
The available options per forum are:

* No file list
* Only on the first page
* On every page

From the file list, the user can directly download the file or jump to the
message which has the file attached to it.

If you are using the Real Names version 2 module to display the real names
for the users, instead of the usernames, then be sure to run Real Names
version 2.1.0 or higher for full Real Names support.


Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "filelist" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "File List". 

- Edit the read.tpl and/or the read_threads.tpl and add the template
  code {HOOK tpl_filelist} at the place where you want the file list
  to appear. It's suggested to add it right before the {LOOP MESSAGES}
  statements in read.tpl, so the template code will look like this:

  ..
  ..
  {HOOK tpl_filelist}
  {LOOP MESSAGES}
  ..
  ..

  For read_threads.tpl, it's suggested to add the code right after
  the message options menu and before displaying the current message.

- Configure for what forums and how you want to display the file list,
  by editing the module's settings.


Customization:
--------------

You can create a separate filelist template for each Phorum template that
you are using. Simply create a file within the template directory named 
mods/filelist/templates/<template>.php (where <template> is the name of
the Phorum template for which you want to write a customized module template).
The easiest way is to copy the default.php to the new filename and start
editing that file.

This module does support multiple languages. You can add a language by
creating a language file in mods/filelist/lang/<language>.php, where
the filename should be the same as the language filename that you are
using for Phorum itself (i.e. inlcude/lang/<language>.php). The easiest
way is to copy the english.php to the new filename and start editing that
file. If you create a new language file, then please post it to the 
module's discussion thread in the Phorum.org forums:
