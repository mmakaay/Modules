Changelog:
----------

2007-01-30 v1.0.5

    - Added support for displaying real names instead of usernames
	  through a new feature in the Real Names module, version 2.1.0. 

2006-08-23 v1.0.4

    - Display the time at which a file was uploaded instead of the
      posting time of the message in which the file is. This will
      be more clear for those cases where the attachments in a message
      are updated with new versions. 

2006-08-14 v1.0.3

    - Corrected displaying of unregistered users in the file list.
      There should be no profile link for those. Thanks to
      Clemens Weiﬂ for the bug report and the fix.

2006-07-25 v1.0.2

    - The language string PMReadMessage is no longer a default Phorum
      language string. Therefore, I added a similar string to the 
      module language files.

2006-05-05 v1.0.1

    - Fixes in the default template: the <th> tags should use align="right"
      and removed stale </h3> closing tag (credits to Brian).

    - Fixed displaying with of the block. In MSIE the block showed up
      wider than the other blocks (reported by CBiLL).

2006-05-04 v1.0.0

    - Initial release
