Changelog:
----------

2008-02-28 v1.1.4

    - Added a configuration option to make it possible to display the
      file list automatically after the header and/or before the footer.

2007-12-14 v1.1.3

    - Fixed undefined index notice for the settings page, which happened
      on first access of the page and after adding forums.
      Thanks to Steve Healy for the report.

    - Implemented support for the new attachment "force download" option.

    - Added French translation. Thanks to notre-planete.info.

2007-10-16 v1.1.2

    - Fixed a problem that caused the filelist to not display
      for threaded and hybrid read views. Thanks to Thomas Seifert
      for pinpointing the problem and for providing a fix.

2007-08-06 v1.1.1

    - Use new file API call phorum_api_file_check_read_access() instead of
      phorum_db_file_get().

2007-08-05 v1.1.0

    - Fully converted to Phorum 5.2.
    - Using real module templates now for the filelist HTML code.
    - Drastic template variable renaming to follow the Phorum 5.2 naming.
    - More docs for template writers in the README.

2007-06-14 v1.0.7

    - Added compatibility for the 5.2 pathinfo changes for the file
      download URL. The pathinfo changes are used to force browsers into
      using the right filename for downloading if a user right
      clicks the URL and chooses "Save link as ...".

2007-01-30 v1.0.6

    - Branched version for Phorum 5.2.
    - v1.0.5 change was rolled back, because display names are handled
      differently in 5.2.

2006-08-23 v1.0.4

    - Display the time at which a file was uploaded instead of the
      posting time of the message in which the file is. This will
      be more clear for those cases where the attachments in a message
      are updated with new versions.

2006-08-14 v1.0.3

    - Corrected displaying of unregistered users in the file list.
      There should be no profile link for those. Thanks to
      Clemens Weiﬂ for the bug report and the fix.

2006-07-25 v1.0.2

    - The language string PMReadMessage is no longer a default Phorum
      language string. Therefore, I added a similar string to the
      module language files.

2006-05-05 v1.0.1

    - Fixes in the default template: the <th> tags should use align="right"
      and removed stale </h3> closing tag (credits to Brian).

    - Fixed displaying with of the block. In MSIE the block showed up
      wider than the other blocks (reported by CBiLL).

2006-05-04 v1.0.0

    - Initial release
