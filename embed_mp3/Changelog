Changelog:
----------

2008-07-06 v1.0.4

    - Implemented proper encoding of the MP3 URLs in the FlashVars value.
      These need to be URLencoded instead of htmlspecialchars-ed.

    - Added a work-around for the problem that the player will cut the
      MP3 URL at the first comma (some kind of playlist support maybe?).
      The "parse_request" hook was used to decode a specially crafted
      file download URL. This hook requires Phorum version 5.2.7.

    - Implemented the feature "Show all MP3 attachments using the embedded
      MP3 player".

2008-01-18 v1.0.3

    - Added an editor tool button, using an icon that was provided by M@AATW.

2008-01-03 v1.0.2

    - Some fixes to the template to make it fully XHTML compliant.

2007-12-08 v1.0.1

    - Deleted float:left for the player. That solves some problems
      when the player is the last item in the message body (it would show
      outside the body div) and I think it is okay when the MP3 player is
      shown on its own line in the body.

2007-11-25 v1.0.0

    - Initial release.
