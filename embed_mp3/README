Module  : Embed MP3
Version : 1.0.4
Author  : Maurice Makaay <maurice@phorum.org>

This module implements an embedded MP3 player. MP3 files can be played
directly from a URL using the [mp3]..[/mp3] BBcode tag. If the
"Embed Attachments" module is installed and activated, it is possible
to use the MP3 player for attachments as well.

To play the MP3 files, the Flash based audio player from the Audio Player
Wordpress plugin by 1pixelout is used. For more information about this
player, check out the web site:

This module only uses the audio-player.js and player.swf from the Wordpress
package. If the player needs an upgrade, then a new zip can be downloaded
from 1pixelout's site and these two files can be put in the "audio-player"
subdirectory of this module.
