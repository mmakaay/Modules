Author  : Maurice Makaay

This module can be used to customize the mail messages that are sent out
by Phorum. You can also do this by editing the language files, but using
this module, you won't have to be afraid of overwriting the modified
language file(s) on upgrades.

--------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "customize_mail_messages" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Customize Mail Messages".

- Go to the settings screen for the module and customize the mail
  messages to your likings.
