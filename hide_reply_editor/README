Module  : Hide Reply Editor
Version : 1.0.2
Author  : Maurice Makaay <maurice@phorum.org>

This module will hide the reply editor on the read page. The editor is only
shown after a user actively clicks the Reply or Quote button.

This will improve the threaded structure of a discussion, because it prevents
the user from simply scrolling down and starting to type, in which case the
reply would always be a reply to the last message. For users that use flat
mode reading, this is no problem, but threaded (or hybrid, which is a form
of threading too) readers would have a hard time following the conversation.
Also, this makes moderation somewhat easier, because "Delete + Replies"
becomes more reliable.

The same effect could be accomplished by setting "Reply form appears: on a
separate page" in the General Settings, since this forces the user to always
click Reply or Quote as well, but then the user is unable to see the rest of
the discussion while typing the new message.
