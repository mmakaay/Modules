Changelog:
----------

2011-01-13 v1.0.2

   - Switched to using jQuery code in the javascript for this module.

   - The editor textarea is now automatically focussed when the editor is
     shown.

2009-10-27 v1.0.1

   - Also make the hide reply editor functionality available when the
     forum is in threaded mode. Initially, this was explicitly not
     implemented, because the module's main target was to improve
     threading structure for flat view and hybrid view. Based on
     demand, the functionality was extended to threaded mode as well.

2009-07-17 v1.0.0

   - Initial release
