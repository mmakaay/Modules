Changelog:
----------

2011-03-28 v1.0.1

    - Removed the "lang" statement from the info.txt. This module does not
      have language strings to translate. In 5.3, stating that a translation
      is available, without having any language file in the module dir at
      all, is treated as an error case.

2007-01-21 v1.0.0

    - Initial release
