Module  : Banner Manager
Version : 1.0.4
Author  : Maurice Makaay <maurice@gitaar.net>

This module makes it possible to display arbitrary blocks of HTML/PHP code
in Phorum pages. Multiple blocks can be defined and you can configure what
block to show on what page. The system was designed for adding banners to
Phorum, but with some fantasy other things are possible too (e.g. adding
a customized page header per forum).

From version 1.0.3 on, date range support has been added, allowing
possibilities such as:

- commemorating public holidays with new banners, like Google does;
- setting up an "Advent Calendar" of 24 banners to be shown
  sequentially in the run up to Christmas;
- advertising upcoming events and automatically cancelling the
  banner after a cut off date.

Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "banner_manager" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Banner Manager";

- After this, go to the module's settings screen to configure
  banner blocks to display and on what pages to display them.


Placement of the banner code:
-----------------------------

By default, the module will print the banner centered on the screen,
on top of the page (right after displaying the header). In case this
is not the location where you want the banner to appear, you can change
the positioning options in the module settings. If the options
"Banner position" and "Banner alignment" are not sufficient for
placing the banner, you can also fully customize where you want the
banner blocks to appear. These are the steps to take:

- Activate the option "Do not display the banner automatically";

- Place the special template variable {MOD_BANNER_MANAGER} in the template(s)
  at the position where you want the banner to appear. This variable
  will be replaced by the code from the banner block.
