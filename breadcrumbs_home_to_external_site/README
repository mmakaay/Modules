Module  : Breadcrumbs 'Home' to External Site 
Version : 1.0.0
Author  : Maurice Makaay <maurice@phorum.org>

This module can be used to modify the breadcrumbs of Phorum in such way
that the original 'Home' breadcrumb is renamed to 'Forums' and that
a new 'Home' link is prepended. The new 'Home' link can be configured
to point to an arbitrary URL.

This is useful for sites that run forums on a deeper level or even another
URL. The new 'Home' breadcrumb can then be used to point back to the
main site.


Installation instructions:
--------------------------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "breadcrumbs_home_to_external_site" to the
  directory "mods" within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Breadcrumbs 'Home' to External Site".

- On the module's settings page, you can configure the URL to use for
  the 'Home' breadcrumb. By default, the breadcrumb will point to the
  root of your website.
