Changelog:
----------

2011-01-09 v1.0.20

    - Added new German language files. Thanks to Oliver Riesen!

		- Added Russian translation. Thanks to phorum.org user sailord.

		- Added Swedish translation. Thanks to phorum.org user CHR.

2010-10-27 v1.0.19

    - A small change to explicitly set the POST action URL for
      Topic Poll forms.

    - Updated the install.php to setup the required custom profile field
		  using the custom fields API code instead of directly hacking the
			custom fields data array.

2010-05-19 v1.0.18

    - Fixed an issue with the voting form being visible after the first
		  anonymous vote when the IP-block is fully disabled. BTW: posting the
			poll for the second time would not register the vote. The only problem
			was that the results were not visible directly after the first post.
			Thanks to Zdravko Balorda for the bug report!

2010-04-18 v1.0.17

    - Renamed constants to avoid redefining the same contstants when
		  the "rate_this_thread" module is enabled as well. That module
			was based on the Topic Poll module and copied the CAST_* constants.

2009-11-08 v1.0.16

    - Fixed displaying of the poll style preview in the admin interface.

2009-10-25 v1.0.15

    - Fixed an issue with execution priorities, that could cause
      other formatting modules to fail.

2009-08-01 v1.0.14

    - Fixed a small bug with using BBcode in the poll question and/or
      answers. When editing a poll, the BBcode would show up as the
      rendered HTML for that BBcode in the edit form. After saving,
      the poll would show the HTML escaped in the page, instead of
      showing the desired formatting.

2009-07-04 v1.0.13

    - Moved the separator between poll and message body to a module
      template, so it can be modified without hacking the code.

    - Fixed an issue where other formatting modules (especially the
      smileys module) could break the form code of the Poll module.
      Thanks to Phorum user paranid for reporting the problem.

    - Removed templates/default, because that one was only there for
      supporting some of the very early 5.2 development versions.

2009-06-05 v1.0.12

    - Made the module compatible with the CSRF protection in Phorum 5.2.11.

    - Added German translation files.
      Thanks to Oliver Riesen.

2008-07-14 v1.0.11

    - Added a new option to the settings for a poll, to make it possible to
      hide all thread reply messages until the visitor casts a vote.

2008-01-01 v1.0.10

    - It is now possible to not add an icon to the subjects in the list
      page for threads that have a poll in them, but instead setup some
      template variables. This way, it's possibly to fully control the
      way in which polls are indicated in the message list page. See the help
      information in the module admin settings for info about this feature.

    - Added a Latin American Spanish translation.
      Thanks to Phorum user "marcelarr".

    - Added a Ukrainian translation.
      Thanks to Phorum user "tadjik".

2007-11-19 v1.0.9

    - Reset the $messages array in the read hook, so each() will get the
      first message in the array. This didn't work correctly if some
      previous read hook from another module iterated over the $messages
      array as well.

2007-08-17 v1.0.8

    - Copied templates/default to templates/emerald to match the default
      fall back template for Phorum 5.2.

2007-07-13 v1.0.7

    - Fixed a compatibility issue for using this module in combination
      with Phorum version 5.1.23. From here on, 5.1.23 is also the minimal
      version for which the module will work.

2007-06-19 v1.0.6

    - Fixed a bug in the feed message rendering.

    - Added an option in the poll editor for displaying the poll before
      or after the message body.

    - Included updated French language file by Fran.

2007-05-01 v1.0.5

    - Fixed a typo in the Dutch language file.

2007-04-06 v1.0.4

    - If a topic is closed, then the poll is closed too now.

2007-02-22 v1.0.3

    - Fix for finding the raw_datestamp on 5.1 systems, in case the
      messages in the format message array are from multiple forums.

2007-01-19 v1.0.2

    - Added German translation (thanks Netwalker!).

    - Added French translation (thanks Fran!).

    - Changed the maximum width for the score bars to 95% instead of 100%,
      to provide some extra space for styling the bars.

    - Fixed a bug which could cause failure to draw the graph after
      editing the poll form (showing only some undefined index
      warnings instead).

    - Added a simple rendering to the format hook for displaying polls
      inside RSS/ATOM feeds. In the feed, the poll will show up as the
      poll question.

2006-09-07 v1.0.1

    - The preview of the poll in the admin interface (for selecting a
      style) resulted into a nested form (voting form within the admin
      form). A change was made, so the poll now doesn't start a
      new form if it's in the admin interface.

2006-09-06 v1.0.0

    - Initial revision
