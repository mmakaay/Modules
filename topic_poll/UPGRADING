Upgrading to v1.0.13

When you have your own modified template for this module, then copy
body_and_poll_separator.tpl from templates/emerald
to templates/<yourtemplate>.

Also, visit the admin interface (admin.php) to let the module reload
its updated hook descriptions (no need to click "Save" on the Modules
page or anything; visiting the admin index page ought to be enough).
If these hook descriptions are not yet updated, you will see codes like

  [mod_topic_poll ......]

in your messages.

Upgrading to v1.0.12

When you have created a custom template for this module, then
you will have to update two template files:

 - templates/<yourtemplate>/editor.tpl
 - templates/<yourtemplate>/voting_form.tpl

In each of these, you will find a <form ....> tag. Right after this
opening tag for the form, add the template variable {POST_VARS}.
You can take a look at the included template in templates/emerald
to see what the files should look like.
