Changelog:
----------

2011-03-28 v1.0.11

    - Added wmode="transparent" to the <embed> tags, which fixes problems
      with movies overlapping HTML elements that should have been overlapping
      the movie instead.

2009-05-21 v1.0.10

    - Added a language string "enter video url" for the URL prompt window.

2007-11-03 v1.0.9

    - Implemented the javascript_register hook.
      This requires Phorum 5.2.2 or newer.

2007-11-01 v1.0.8

    - Honor the "disable bbcode for this post" flag (a feature of the
      BBcode module).

2007-10-14 v1.0.7

    - Added support for www.break.com and www.ebaumsworld.com URLs.

2007-07-09 v1.0.6

2007-07-07 v1.0.5

    - Added an option to display a video button in the Editor Tools bar.

2007-07-07 v1.0.4

    - Added vimeo.com video support.

2007-06-13 v1.0.3

    - Removed <object> tag from the embedding code, because that can cause
      some weird conflicts with MSIE browsers in combination with JavaScript
      code. I've seen conflicts with the Slimbox script (mootools based
      lightbox) on my site, but there are other scripts which show the
      same problem, judging the number of reports about the problem.

      Since <embed> seems to work for all browsers that I tested, I stick
      to that for now and leave the <object> code for the future.

2007-06-13 v1.0.2

    - Made Google video support work for international Google mirrors too.

2007-06-13 v1.0.1
