Module  : BBcode Video
Version : 1.0.11
Author  : Maurice Makaay <maurice@phorum.org>

This module allows embedding of YouTube, Google, vimeo.com, break.com and
ebaumsworld.com videos in forum messages by using the [video]...[/video]
bbcode tags. Here is an example of how a video link would look in a message:

 [video]http://www.youtube.com/v/abcDeFgHiJ1[/video]

The module does recognize multiple types of video URLs automatically. So
users do not have to (and will not, in my experience ;-) post the actual
video resource URL as in the above example, but they can post URLs like
these too:

 [video]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkFPbIEluEU&mode=related&search=[/video]

 [video]http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1234567890123456789[/video]

The module can be told to automatically replace all recognized video URLs with
embedded videos. This is a special feature, which can be enabled through the
module settings screen. If you enable this feature then plain video URLs and
[url] surrounded video URLs will be replaced by embedded videos too.

Examples:

 http ://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkFPbIEluEU&mode=related&search=

 [url]http://www.youtube.com/v/abcDeFgHiJ1[/url]

 http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1234567890123456789
