Module  : POP3 Phorummail
Version : 1.0.0
Author  : Thomas Seifert <thomas@phorum.org>

This module implements a mailimport from pop3 mailaccounts into phorum.

This script is derived from 
1) http://www.phorum.org/phorum5/read.php?16,121015
   pop3-collector from woleium

2) http://www.phorum.org/phorum5/read.php?16,14081
   Phorummail by Brian Moon

Updated, reworked and turned into a module for current 5.2 (tested with 5.2.9) 
by Thomas Seifert ( thomas@phorum.org ).


Installation instructions:
--------------------------

- check that the Mail_mimeDecode package from PEAR has been installed or install
  it ( http://pear.php.net/package/Mail_mimeDecode ), its required for the import

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "pop3phorummail" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Configure the module through the module's settings page.

- Enable the module "POP3 Phorummail".

- Setup a cronjob to run scheduled tasks
  for example like this (would run the tasks every 5 minutes):
  */5 * * * * cd /home/your/phorum/directory && /usr/bin/php ./script.php --scheduled > /dev/null

  I recommend to run the script by hand until everything is working correctly.
