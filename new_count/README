Module  : New Count
Version : 1.13
Author  : Panu Artimo
Patches : Brian Moon (version 1.8)

Shows the number of new messages in threads instead of just indicating
that there are new messages. It also computes totals for all new messages
and treads in the forum index and message lists.

Note from the original author (Panu):
You can do whatever you want with this code, as long as I am given some
credit somewhere in your code.


Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "new_count" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "New posts in thread".


Template customization:
-----------------------

* New thread and message stats:

  By default, this module will show a total count for new threads and
  messages after the page header. If you do not want the totals to appear
  there, go to the settings screen for this module and disable automatic
  displaying of the totals.

  After this, you can put the totals at appropriate places in your
  templates. These would typically go into header.tpl, list.tpl and/or
  index.tpl. You can use the following template variables:

    {MOD_NEW_COUNT}       The fully formatted new count totals HTML code.
    {NEW_MESSAGES}        The total number of new messages.
    {NEW_THREADS}         The total number of new threads.


* Showing the number of new messages for threads on the list page:

  The default Phorum 5.1 template will already show the amount of new
  messages for threads on the list page if you have this module enabled.
  The default Phorum 5.2 template ("emerald") however, will not do so.
  In that template, the new message information {MESSAGES->new} is just
  used to change the icon in front of threads that contain new messages.
  To display the number of new messages for threads in that template,
  you will have to edit the list.tpl template.

  You can use these template variables inside the {LOOP MESSAGES} loop:

    {MESSAGES->new}       A formatted string "[X] new" that is set if there
                          are new messages for the thread.
    {MESSAGES->new_count} The number of new messages for the thread.

  You can for example use the following code somewhere after the
  {MESSAGES->subject} in list.tpl to match the old 5.1 behavior:

    {IF MESSAGES->new}
      <a href="{MESSAGES->URL->NEWPOST}">
        <span class="new-indicator">{MESSAGES->new}</span>
      </a>
    {/IF}


Localization:
-------------

This module supports localization through the language files in the
lang directory. If your language is not supported by the module, copy
english.php to <yourlanguage>.php and update the language strings in it.

If you create a new language file, please post it to the Phorum forums,
so it can be added to this distribution.


Dedicated:

To my (Panu) 2 sons who wanted to be born 2 months beforehand and I
couldn't sleep... And I'm 2000 km away. They are now 8 months old,
time goes so fast...
