Changelog:
----------

2008-01-02 1.13 Maurice Makaay

   - Cleaned up some code.

   - The language strings are now put in their own "mod_new_count"
     namespace below $PHORUM['LANG'].

   - Added an extra template variable {MESSAGES->new_count} for the
     list.tpl page, that does not contain a fully formatted new count
     string, but only the number of new messages.

   - Extended the documentation for describing how to extend the list.tpl
     template to show the number of new messages in the "emerald" template.

1.12 Maurice Makaay

   - Fixed another couple of small undefined index warnings.

1.11 Maurice Makaay

   - Fixed PHP warning that was shown in case no forums were defined at all.

1.10 Maurice Makaay

   - PHP warnings were shown in case there was a "thread moved" notification
     in the forum. These notifications are now skipped when counting new
     messages for the message list.

   - Modified the module, so now it will work for both Phorum 5.1 and 5.2.

   - Removed the need for the common hook in the code (it was used for
     setting up some data to prevent undefined index warnings later on,
     but this could be handled more gracefully).

1.9.2 Oliver Riesen

   - Changed the module to work with Phorum 5.2, because of some changes
     that were made in that version for formatting numbers.

   - Fixed some HTML validation errors as reported by chanh.

1.9 Maurice Makaay

   - Added a settings screen so now users of this module can choose to
     either show the totals automatically in the header or hack the
     templates to exactly show it where they like it to be.

   - Another setting has been added to configure if the totals for
     the index and list pages should be displayed in case no new
     messages are available. Hiding was the default behaviour in the
     previous versions.

   - Displaying of forum totals for the list view now also works when in
     threaded view.

   - Migrated information about the module from the module code
     to a README and Changelog file.

   - Added a new localization option, so languages that use multiple
     plural words can set them in the language strings (you can now
     define the default new_count_single and new_count_multiple, but
     also new_count_2, new_count_3, etc.).

   - Added a Dutch translation for the module.

1.8 Brian moon

   - made the code work as expected in list for the totals. Added total
     thread count. Made language vars available to templates.

1.7 Panu Artimo

   - Added Total new count for all threads by CBiLL's request, you need
     to hack list-template to see it

1.6 Panu Artimo

   - prevent error/warning when there's no newinfo or messageid's

1.5 Panu Artimo

   - Use Phorums internal module localisation system, cosmetic changes/fixes

1.4 Panu Artimo

   - Don't count new messages if not logged in and if threaded list view
     is in use, I quess counting of new messages finally works as it's
     supposed to.

1.3 Panu Artimo

   - Forgot to put back the check for minid

1.2 Panu Artimo

   - Trashed the query, it was wrong anyway. Get all msg_id's in
     thread from $message

1.1 Panu Artimo

   - Uses existing list-hook instead of hack.
