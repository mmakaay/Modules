Changelog:
----------

2009-11-17 v1.0.6

   - Updated for compatibility with Spam Hurdles version 2.

2009-08-03 v1.0.5

   - Removed a </style> tag from the css template file. This one was
     a left behind from early development, when the stylesheet was not
     yet incorportated in Phorum's css structure.
     For me, this bug caused the color popup menu in the editor tools
     to fail, but depending on the installation, the effect of the bug
     might be different.

   - Modified the templates a bit, to fix a rendering issue in Firefox.
     The border around the quick reply editor would not always show up
     on all sides.

2009-07-27 v1.0.4

   - The Ajax call for setting up the reply form now transforms the
     reply "Re: ..." subject not HTML-encoded. For filling the form field
     using JavaScript, this is not neccessary. This fixes the bug where
     a subject like "This & that" would get "Re: This &amp; that" in the
     Quick Reply editor. Thanks to phorum.org user "noe" for reporting
     the bug!

2009-07-25 v1.0.3

   - Added a French translation by Phorum user ab1.

   - Some changes to make the module compatible with an upcoming version
     of the Spam Hurdles module.

2009-07-23 v1.0.2

   - Move the quick editor up if it is not completely visible in the browser.

   - Added Ajax request caching for Phorum 5.2 (for development version
     5.3 it was already working).

2009-07-21 v1.0.1

   - Fixed some MSIE JavaScript compatibility issues.
     Thanks to CBiLL for noticing the problem.

   - Added a classic template compatible module template.

   - Moved the bulk of the JavaScript code to a main JavaScript file.
     This way, we prevent having to copy over the full JavaScript file
     from the Emerald template when creating a new template.

2009-07-21 v1.0.0

   - Initial release.
