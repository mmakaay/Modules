hook: format|phorum_mod_html_format

# We want the format hook to run as the first one in the chain, so
# other hooks that work on HTML tags can be sure that replacements like
# "&gt;" to ">" are done.
#
# Additionally, we do not want output from modules that implement BBcode
# tags to be checked and stripped by this module, because there are some
# BBcode tags for which the output includes javascript code that we
# defenitely want to run. So for these, it is the task of the BBcode
# tag implementing module to make sure that the produced code is XSS safe.

priority: run hook format before *
