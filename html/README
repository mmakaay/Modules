Module  : HTML in Messages
Version : 2.0.0
Author  : Phorum Dev Team

This module allow HTML to be used in forum messages. This includes allowing
special characters that are HTML encoded.

The module makes use of the HTML Purifier library to filter the HTML code.
This filtering is done to prevent visitors from adding cross site scripting
(XSS) code to their messages. In addition to filtering for security, the
HTML Purifier also takes care of cleaning up the visitor's HTML code, by
preventing errors in the code from breaking the page layout. E.g. "<b>Hello"
would be turned into "<b>Hello</b>".

  "mods" within your Phorum installation.

  go to the "Modules" section;

- Go to the settings screen for the module to configure the module.
  You will have to select the HTML doctype that you are using in your
