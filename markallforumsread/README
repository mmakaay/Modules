Module  : Mark All Forums Read
Version : 1.0.9
Author  : Maurice Makaay

Displays a link to mark all forums read on the forum index page.

Troubleshooting note:
There was a problem in the database layers before Phorum version 5.1.16,
that caused announcements not to be marked read in a forum when the forum
was marked read. So if new messages are available in the forum after
clicking the mark all forums read link, then they might be announcements.
Upgrading Phorum should fix this.


Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "markallforumsread" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Mark All Forums Read".

- Configure the module through the module's settings page.


Customization:
--------------

Using the options in the module settings, you can automatically display
the link for marking all forums read after the header and/or before the
footer. If you want to create your own links by editing the templates
(index_classic.tpl / index_new.tpl), then you can disable the
automatic displaying options and make use of the following template
variables:

  {URL->MARKALLFORUMSREAD}     the url for marking the forums read
  {MARKALLFORUMSREAD_NEWCOUNT} the number of new messages available
  {MARKALLFORUMSREAD_LINK}     the full formatted link

Using these template variables, you could for example create the following
link in your template, to display a link that is only visible in case
there are new messages available:

  {IF URL->MARKALLFORUMSREAD}
    {IF MARKALLFORUMSREAD_NEWCOUNT}
      <a href="{URL->MARKALLFORUMSREAD}">
        {LANG->MarkAllForumsRead}
      </a>
    {/IF}
  {/IF}

Mind that you'll have to check if {IF URL->MARKALLFORUMSREAD} is set, so
the link won't be displayed for visitors that are not logged in.
