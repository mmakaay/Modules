Changelog:
----------

2009-07-22 v1.0.9

    - Added French language file. 
      Thanks to Phorum.org user manuvb (Manu).

    - Added Czech language file. 
      Thanks to Phorum.org user timqui.

2008-04-21 v1.0.8

   - Instead of only marking the forums read that are visible on the
     index page, the "mark all forums read" link now marks all forums
     that are in the current vroot as read (which does cover the
     definition of "all forums" a lot better). Thanks to Phorum user
     "Lammi41" for noticing the deficiency.

2007-10-23 v1.0.7

    - Added Turkish language file. 
      Thanks to Serdar of paticik.com.

2007-07-07 v1.0.6

    - Fixed a small logic fix, which caused automatic displaying of
      the "Mark all forums read" link to fail.

2007-07-07 v1.0.5

    - Just a small change to add the 5.2 style URL format
      {URL->MARKALLFORUMSREAD}. The old URL template var is still
      available as well.

2007-01-03 v1.0.4

    - Adjusted cleaning up the newflags cache to work with the cache_version
      forum field too (only for 5.2 development version, not for 5.1.x).

2006-10-03 v1.0.3

    - Fixed an undefined index warning in case there are no forums
      displayed on the index page.

2006-08-24 v1.0.2

    - Added a redirect back to the plain index URL, to prevent people from
      bookmarking the URL with the mark all read argument in it.

2006-08-23 v1.0.1

    - Found out what was causing announcements not to be marked read when
      marking a forum read. This turned out to be a core problem. This has
      been fixed in Phorum 5.1.16. I removed the experimental code for marking
      announcements read from this mod.

2006-08-23 v1.0.0

    - Initial revision
